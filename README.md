# GAN applied on MNIST dataset

**Inspired by** the article on Towards Data Science: "Building a GAN with PyTorch" of Ta-Ying Cheng and his github

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), proposed by Goodfellow et al. in 2014, revolutionized a domain of image generation in computer vision. The original GAN name: Vanilla GAN. ^.^

In practice, however, the minimax game would often lead to the network not converging, so it is important to carefully tune the training process. Hyperparameters such as learning rates are significantly more important in training a GAN â€” small changes may lead to GANs generating a single output regardless of the input noises
